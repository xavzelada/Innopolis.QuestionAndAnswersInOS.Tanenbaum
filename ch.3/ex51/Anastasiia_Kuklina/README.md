# Problem - Chapter 3 task 51
Write a program that simulates a paging system using the aging algorithm. The number of page frames is a parameter. The sequence of page references should be read from a file. For a given input file, plot the number of page faults per 1000 memory references as a function of the number of page frames available.

## Solution description
### Files
`page_generator.py` - script to create a list of random numbers. They are represent page references.
` solution.c ` - C program to simulate aging algorithm
`Graph.png` - picture with graph which represents Dependency of page faults to number of virtual memory pages

##### Input: 
* Console: Number of page frames = N
* File: ```input.txt``` - List of numbers of page references (generated by ```page_generator.py```)

##### Output 
* Console: Number of pages = N, Page faults = P
